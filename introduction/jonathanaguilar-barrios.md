My name is Jonathan Aguilar-Barrios and I am intrested in taking Ap CSP because I want to lern more about technology and coding.
I would love to take AP csp so I can learn more about technology, since it is a part of our day to day lives.
One thing I am curious about computing and technology is learning how apps are made.
